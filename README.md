# ðŸ“Š Project: Simple API

### Goal: Display data returned from an api

### Process:

<ol>
  <li>Simple API, yes, but API's are not simple <em>(to me)</em>.</li>
  <li>The HTML and CSS was so simple a baby could do it!  Emojis for the user to click on and describe their emotion.</li>
  <li>The JavaScript, erm, however, was uh, not that easy.</li>  
  <li>I understand the concept of fetching a lot more after doing it so many times today (because this was not my first go).  Most of the challenge cames from finding an API that was still active or didn't contain a CORS error.</li>
  <li>Originally, I had another thesaurus API, but the arrays were not as <em>plump</em> as I would have liked, but I digress.</li>
  <li>Each of the emojis displayed are coded to equal a string after being clicked i.e, smiling emoji is 'happy' or the somber emoji is 'sad'.</li>
  <li>I grab a theraurus API from Merriam Websterm and a random item from the array of the descriptors based on the emoji's string and pop that bad boy right in the HTML.</li>
  <li>Some of the language does not take into account the tense of the word, like sad, can bring up 'saddening' which doesn't make sense for the descriptor 'sad'.</li>
  <li>But all around, it was not to bad, especially when in comparison to the complex ones.</li>

<p>Overall, I am proud of the API, but not the CSS.  I wish I had more time to tweak it before I turned it in, but that's as old as a tale as, well, <em>time</em>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I completed the challenge: | 4 <em>It's done, but I wish that the thesaurus took into account the tense of words.</em></li>
  <li>I feel good about my code: | 4 <em>The JavaScript was actually pretty solid on this one, so I like it.  Once again, I just wish I could make it prettier.</em></li>
</ul>
