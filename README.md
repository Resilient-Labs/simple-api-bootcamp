# Simple Math API

<a href="https://kellychhe-simple-math-api.netlify.app/">This website </a>tests the users mental math knowlege. The API generates a random expression and the user enters the answer in the form. Then the user is notified if they got the answer correct after they click submit.

## Languages Used

This was created using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript.

I think math is fun so when I found this API, I was excited to use it. At first, I had a button that revealed the answer when clicked, but someone noted that it would not be an interative site. I decided to have the user actively participate and submit a form with their answer. I added some simple CSS and appeneded all of the API information in the DOM.

## Lessons Learned

I learned the importance of keeping in mind how users interact with a web app.
