# ðŸ“Š Project: Simple API 1

### Goal: Display data returned from an api

I used a simple cat fact api to return a cat fact every time the button is clicked!

### What I did to build this app:

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a cat fact API to code this project.

### Lessons Learned :

- I ingrained more JS methods into memory with this API such as createTextNode and appendChild, which helped me with my other API projects as well.
