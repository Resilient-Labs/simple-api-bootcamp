### Goal: Display data returned from an api

In this project, I created a simple API to Display data returned from a Studio Ghibli API.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

I've always loved Studio Ghibli Movies, so I created this simple API app to retrieve the brief bio, title, image, and release year here to see the full collection of all Ghibli movies. There's so many I haven't seen! I used simple CSS, and this was my first project using an API. 

## Lessons Learned:

It was actually difficult to find an API online that worked, so that definitely took longer than expected. I was able to use some of my previous JavaScript patterns to access the array of objects which was useful.
