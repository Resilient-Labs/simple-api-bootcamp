Users input their desired search term, and the app sends a request to the Pexels API to fetch images related to the query. A random image from the search results is displayed on the webpage. The user has the option to continue clicking "search" to fetch a new image should they want to keep looking until desired results. If no images are found for the given search, a corresponding message is shown.
