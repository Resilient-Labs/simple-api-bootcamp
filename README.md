# ðŸ“Š Project: Simple API 1

### Goal: Display data returned from an api

### The project that I built allows the user to check the price of bitcoin in real time. It displays the current price in both USD and Euro currency.

#### How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript
To create this app the first major step I took was to research a working API to retreive the current prices. After I found one I created a fetch within JavaScript.
Next I created varibles to display the information given from the fetched API in the dom.

### Lessons Learned: 
The major lesson I learned from this project was how to properly fetch an API.
