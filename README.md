# About this project
This project uses an exercise API which allows users to pick a muscle group and displays 3 exercises they can do using that muscle group.

Checkout my project here: https://jacinthadev.github.io/simple-api-1/

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript


## Lessons Learned:
This API used AJAX, so I learned how to fetch using AJAX. Also, I gained experience dealing with the quirks of APIs. This API sometimes returned duplicates of exercises, so I had to control for that in my code.
