## Design and Development:
**Tech Used** HTML, CSS, JavaScript: 
Using Harry Potter's API, retrieve 4 Hogwarts houses and display randomly along with house information.

## Reflections:
If I don't ever make anything as a developer again, I can be happy knowing that I've been able to create a Sorting Hat website. I only used their open API to fetch the houses, the other keys they have may be more complicated to access!

## API Source:
**Harry Potter:** https://www.potterapi.com/
