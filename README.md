You Have Food at Home

Here is a simple recipe generator to help you find inspiration to cook food at home, instead of eating out.

I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
This project is one of my first individual API projects. I wish I found an API with the recipe instructions as well. In the future I want to build something more complex and food related. Very fun project.
