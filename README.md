# Tech Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript 
This project took HTML, CSS, and Javascript to get the desired result. Used an API to extract data
and display it back on the DOM. 
# Lessons Learned
This showed me how to fetch and used .then for the first time where I extracted more than 
one piece of data from an object and displayed it to the DOM. This also taught me how powerful
APIs and objects could potentially be, learning how to change the data into a form that could be displayed back on the 
DOM that wasn't text showed me how much control of the data I had in javascript. Learning to change src tags from within the HTML
through javascript was very eye opening.
