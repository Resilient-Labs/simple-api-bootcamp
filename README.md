# Museum API

This is my Animal Crossing museum API! Users are able to click the button and receive a random artwork from Blathers' museum! It includes the name of the piece and a short description of it as well.

## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Thoughts:

Really happy with how this came out. I'm super surprised that there's so many Animal Crossing API's. I did villagers for a complex API already, so I decided to do artwork from the museum for this project! I was able to include a short description and play around a little bit with what details I wanted to show up and what I didn't want to show up.
