## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I created a wireframe for currency converter using 2 inputs to compare to eachother and a button to submit your request using HTML and JavaScript. Next I used CSS to center the inputs and the button as well as the result of the request. Next I used JavaScript to create the behavior with the buttons and the inputs to request information from the APIs database.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that it'll ease problems by searching for the APIs ahead of time so you can find one that would work for you.
