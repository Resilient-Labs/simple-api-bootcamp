      <p>“A thousand years or more ago,<br>
          When I was newly sewn,<br>
          There lived four wizards of renown,<br>
          Whose name are still well-known:<br>
          Bold Gryffindor from wild moor,<br>
          Fair Ravlenclaw from glen,<br>
          Sweet Hufflepuff from valley broad,<br>
          Shrewd Slytherin from fen.<br>
          They share a wish, a hope, a dream,<br>
          They hatched a daring plan,<br>
          To educate young sorcerers,<br>
          Thus Hogwarts school began.<br>
          Now each of these four founders<br>
          Formed their own house, for each<br>
          Did value different virtues,<br>
          In the ones they had to teach.<br>
          By Gryffindor, the bravest were<br>
          Prized far beyond the rest;<br>
          For Ravenclaw, the cleverest<br>
          Would always be the best;<br>
          For Hufflepuff, hardworkers were<br>
          Most worthy of admission;<br>
          And power-hungry Slytherin<br>
          Loved those of great ambition.<br>
          While still alive they did divide<br>
          Their favourates from the throng,<br>
          Yet how to pick the worthy ones<br>
          When they were dead and gone?<br>
          'Twas Gryffindor who found the way,<br>
          He whipped me off his head<br>
          The founders put some brains in me<br>
          So I could choose instead!<br>
          Now slip me snug around your ears,<br>
          I've never yet been wrong,<br>
          I'll have alook inside your mind<br>
          And tell where you belong!” </p>
