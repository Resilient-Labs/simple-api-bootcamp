# Project: Simple api
## Applying my API fetching skills to simple API that I have not used before so that I may maintain the skill.

## My application is for user who are stuck on a word they do not know the definition of. They can place the word into the input of my web application and will receive the Part of speech, definition and a small sentence where the word is described.

# How to use:
#### Place word in the input field where it says "enter word"
#### Press on the "click me" button and the information for the word will populate.

# Technologies used:
## JavaScript
## API
## HTML5
## CSS
